# Source Codes for a Deformatable User Interface

## About

Source codes in this repository implement a Deformatable User Interface (DUI) for music manipulation. 

## Build and Run

Implement the hardware devices and upload the `arduino.ino` program to your Arduino Nano board. You may need the Arduino keypad library, [here](http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/Keypad).

[ChucK](http://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/) programs under the [chuck](chuck/) directory are for Windows only, for the prompt lines called in the programs are in batch. And since system calls are used for logging, you need to run ChucK virtual machine in `--caution-to-the-wind` mode.
